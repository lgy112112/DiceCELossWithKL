# ðŸ§  Enhanced Segmentation Loss Function

This repository contains the implementation of `DiceCELossWithKL`, an enhanced loss function for segmentation tasks that combines Dice loss, Cross-Entropy loss, and KL divergence to improve model performance on segmentation datasets.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Dice Loss**: Measures the overlap between two samples.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Computes the difference between two probability distributions for a given random variable or set of events.
- **KL Divergence**: Adds a regularization term to penalize the difference in probability distributions between the predictions and the ground truth.

## ðŸ›  Installation

To use this loss function, you need to have Python installed along with PyTorch and MONAI. It is easy to handle so I won't guide you here(sorryðŸ˜Š)

First, clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgy112112/DiceCELossWithKL.git
```
