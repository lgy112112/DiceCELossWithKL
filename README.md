# ðŸ§  Enhanced Segmentation Loss Function

This repository contains the implementation of `DiceCELossWithKL`, an enhanced loss function for segmentation tasks that combines Dice loss, Cross-Entropy loss, and KL divergence to improve model performance on segmentation datasets.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Dice Loss**: Measures the overlap between two samples.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Computes the difference between two probability distributions for a given random variable or set of events.
- **KL Divergence**: Adds a regularization term to penalize the difference in probability distributions between the predictions and the ground truth.

## ðŸ›  Installation

To use this loss function, you need to have Python installed along with PyTorch and MONAI. It is easy to handle so I won't guide you here(sorryðŸ˜Š)

First, clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgy112112/DiceCELossWithKL.git
```

The images respectively show the original image, the ground truth mask, the predicted mask by the KL-constrained model, and the predicted mask by the standard model. The first two rows clearly demonstrate the superiority of the KL-constrained model in shape control and over-segmentation control. It better fits the shape of the organs in the predictions. In contrast, the standard model, while predicting normal shapes, exhibits "hallucinations" or over-segmentation in blank areas, losing reference value. Similarly, in the third row, the standard model also shows over-segmentation of the gallbladder, whereas the KL model not only controls over-segmentation of this small class but also shows excellent shape control in complex segmentation scenarios.

Here's the translated table with the corresponding English explanation formatted for the README file:

## ðŸ™ŒComparison of Model Using Different Loss Performance

The following table shows the performance metrics of the KL-constrained model and the standard model for various organs. The images respectively show the original image, the ground truth mask, the predicted mask by the KL-constrained model, and the predicted mask by the standard model. The first two rows clearly demonstrate the superiority of the KL-constrained model in shape control and over-segmentation control. It better fits the shape of the organs in the predictions. In contrast, the standard model, while predicting normal shapes, exhibits "hallucinations" or over-segmentation in blank areas, losing reference value. Similarly, in the third row, the standard model also shows over-segmentation of the gallbladder, whereas the KL model not only controls over-segmentation of this small class but also shows excellent shape control in complex segmentation scenarios.

The table above clearly shows that the KL-constrained model achieves higher F1 scores and IoU values for most organs, indicating better segmentation performance compared to the standard model.
